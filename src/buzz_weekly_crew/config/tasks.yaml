  expected_output: >
    A json object containing a number of selected articles

select_articles_task:
  description: >
    From the list of articles, select the top {number-of-articles-in-blog-post} most interesting articles.  Mix them up in order, with the most interesting article first. It is important that the topic of the article is clearly about these topics: {topics}. Also choose an overall title for the blog that is fun and compelling, and summarises the articles in the newsletter. Title should not be obviously generated by an LLM, and just reflect the selected articles. No big made up words, no colons etc.
  expected_output: >
    A json object containing the title, an empty image url that will be populated in the next step and a list of the selected articles

create_image_task:
  description: >
    Generate an image that visually represents the content of the finalized blog post.
    The image should align with the themes or main points of the post. The url should be added in the selected articles output json data.
  expected_output: >
    A json object containing the title, an image url and a list of the selected articles

format_task:
  description: >
    Compile the summaries into a well-formatted text suitable for publishing. The text will be published in the weekly blog called {blog-name}. 
    Your final answer MUST include a formatted document in Markdown with the following format:
    
    1. Start with a title for this week's newsletter as stated in the selected articles json data. 
    2. Add the image as stated in the selected articles json data. 
    3. Continue with a text that in a 4-5 sentences summarizes all the articles.
    4. Then include all the articles in the following format for each article. 
    5. End with a text summarizing the content of this weeks selected articles and also thanking the readers for reading, wish them a great weekend and encourage them to read also next week.

    So the end result should have this format:

    ### TITLE FOR THIS WEEKS NEWSLETTER
    ![An alt text that summarises the blog post](image-link-from-json-data "This weeks blog title")
    SUMMARY OF THIS WEEKS NEWSLETTER CONTENT

    (for each article use this format below)
    ## TITLE (rewritten in a more compelling way for readers), (new row)
    _PUBLISHED DATE_ (on new line, in italic, format like 16 July, 2024. Replace with the actual date, no need for writing Published date:)
    (blank row)
    DESCRIPTION (on new line rewritten in a more compelling way for readers)
    (blank row)
    [Read the story](article-link)

    ---

    (End summary text goes here where we thank the readers for reading, wish them a great weekend and encourage them to read also next week.)
